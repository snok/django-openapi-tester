i18n

If you're maintaining a static schema file, with internationalized routes,
and you would like to document them by substituting the i18n component
with a general parameter, this is supported. Simply set the ``PARAMETERIZED_I18N_NAME`` setting in you ``SWAGGER_TESTER``
settings.

When the ``PARAMETERIZED_I18N_NAME`` is set as any string other than a blank string, we will replace
the i18n component of your paths with ``'{PARAMETERIZED_I18N_NAME}'``, meaning that with a value of ``"language"``, the path, ``/en/api/v1/items`` becomes ``/{language}/api/v1/items``.

This should enable you to move having to duplicate your documentation ``n`` times, where ``n`` is the number of languages you support

.. code:: yaml

  /en/api/v1/i18n:
    ...
  /de/api/v1/i18n:
    ...
  /es/api/v1/i18n:
    ...
  /fr/api/v1/i18n:
    ...

to generalising the i18n component of the path and removing the need for duplication:

.. code:: yaml

  /{language}/api/v1/i18n:
    get:
      operationId: listLanguages
      description: ''
      parameters:
        - name: language
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
            enum: [en, de, es, fr]
          description: 'The response content language.'
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  languages:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      description: "French language"
                      type: "string"
                      example: "French"

This is a bit of an experimental feature, and contributions are welcome if you want to change or improve this.
