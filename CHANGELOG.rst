2.0.0 2020-09-14
----------------

**Breaking changes**

Version 2.0.0 introduces new required package settings, which means existing implementations will need to set up their ``SWAGGER_TESTER`` settings again before package functions will run.

Specifically:

* New required setting, ``SCHEMA_LOADER``, was added.
* Existing setting, ``CASE``, was replaced by new setting, ``CASE_TESTER``, which now takes a callable case validation function rather than a string.

**Non-breaking changes**

* New optional setting, ``CASE_PASSLIST``, was added, allowing projects to exclude keys from case checking on a general basis.
* Excess schema iterations have been eliminated, and code made more consise by consolidating case checking, response checking, and response data checking into a single loop.
* Shared schema loading logic consolidated in a schema loading base class, making it easy to create new loading classes for currently unsupported swagger implementations. This also allows us to unify the API for the ``validate_response`` function, rather than having separate import paths per implementation.
* Upgraded demo project from Django 2.2.6 to Django 3.1
* Improved test suite, test coverage, and fixed a number of minor bugs from v1
